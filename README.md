# Schrodinger-Python--GPU-

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook `schrodinger.ipynb`, which is designed for computational modeling, simulations, or data analysis in physics, artificial intelligence, or related domains.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you will need the following:

1. **Python Environment:**
   - Python 3.8 or later
   - Anaconda/Miniconda for simplified environment management (optional but recommended)

2. **Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python libraries with the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, ensure the following packages are installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `scipy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `jupyter`
   - `tqdm`
   - Additional domain-specific libraries as indicated by the notebook content

3. **Jupyter Notebook:**
   Install Jupyter if not already available:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open your terminal or Anaconda prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `schrodinger.ipynb` file:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook schrodinger.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the Notebook:**
   Step through each cell sequentially to execute the code. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed before running the cells.

3. **Potential Warnings:**
   If you encounter the warning below, update the necessary libraries:
   ```
   IProgress not found. Please update jupyter and ipywidgets. See https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html
   ```
   Use the following commands to update:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade jupyter ipywidgets
   ```
